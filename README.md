# Item-Finder
Ever forget where in the garage you put your tools? Or which cabinet has your favorite cup? Or which book shelf you keep that book in? Or where the keys for that lockbox you keep your most important documents in are? Item Finder is here to help!  Keep the location of all the objects in your house documented using this cool virtual reality app.  Create a digital version of your home, warehouse, store, or any other location, and then place items in it to remember where they are stored!  Then, next time you forget where that item is, just open up this handy app and it will guide you to where that item is located!  App can work in virtual or augmented reality, or just be used as a normal pc or phone app.
